# Leroy Groves CV / Resume

## Introduction
---
As you will see from the attached CV, I am a 'career changer'. I started my working life as a _Central Government Senior Research Officer_ and _Project Manager_ and have worked in the University Sector on a number of social research projects.   


This cv represents one of the first coding / web development projects that I have openly shared and should be regarded as a _live_ document to which I will periodically add recent achievements and projects.


## Technologies
---
_HTML_ and _CSS_ have been checked using validators.  

The _HTML_ and _CSS_ have been formatted using inline beautifiers so as to ensure that they are easy to read.

CSS Grids have been used for the general structure of the document and Flex Box has been used for _fine tuning_.  

A general _SMACSS_ approach has been used to order the CSS. That is, the CSS code has been separated into _Base_, _Layoout_, _Module_ and _State_ sections.

## Acknowledgments
___
I would like to thank my Mentor, Jonathan Root, for his patience and guidance in developing this CV.
